              Ploutos Page Limited is a Lagos-based fintech and accounting solutions company. We provide financial management tools and services for Nigeria's MSMEs — from the market trader who has never kept a record, to the established business that needs an audited statement for a bank loan.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our mission is to make every business financially visible — by giving them the tools to capture their data, the platform to manage their finances, and the infrastructure to prove their performance to banks, regulators, and investors.

                  Fifteen years ago, my mother ran a business in the open market. She worked hard every day and had loyal customers. But like many market entrepreneurs, she kept no structured financial records.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When the business declined, there was no financial history to understand what went wrong. No books. No reports. No data to pass on. If proper records had existed, my sisters and I might have inherited and grown that business. Instead, it disappeared.

                This experience is the reason we built Ploutos Page. Because businesses should not die simply because there was no financial data.
